                    <p>In the United States, approximately <b>1.6 million individuals are being held in federal and state prisons</b>.</p>
                    <p>In 2015, of the more than 700,000 individuals detained in local jails, <b>63% were unconvicted and awaiting trial</b> – also known as pre-trial detention. <a href='https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ji15.pdf'>[1]</a></p>
                    <p>The cost of detaining so many individuals is <b>over $80 billion</b> – just to operate the jails and prisons. <a href='https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/money.html'>[2]</a></p>
                    <p>Moreover, <b>persons of color make up nearly 70% of individuals in pre-trial detention</b>, despite representing only a 25% of the United States population.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>There are various systemic factors contributing to this issue. Here we will be exploring one in particular – <b>the use of algorithms and data via pre-trial risk assessment instruments</b>, or PRAIs.</p>
                    <p>PRAIs are intended to standardize pre-trial decision-making by providing information about or <b>“predicting” a defendant’s likelihood of re-offending or failing to appear in court</b>.</p>
                    <p>PRAIs can be qualitative, quantitative, or a combination of the two. Jurisdictions using qualitative or combination instruments experience more jail overcrowding than those that do not, as pre-trial detention is disproportionately recommended. <a href='https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/PretrialRiskAssessmentResearchSummary.pdf'>[3]</a></p>

                    <p>PRAIs are not only used to predict a defendant's likelihood of re-offending. <b>These algorithms are increasingly being used to set the terms of the defendant's detention</b>, such as setting the amount of their bond.</p>
                    <p>However, there is a concern that <b>the data that these algorithms are trained on may be biased</b>, due to the association between many risk factors and systemic social and economic inequities.</p>
                    <p><b>But how can we know, when we are unable to inspect the algorithms themselves?</b></p>

                    <p>The state of Connecticut has also, since July 2016, made available data on all its pre-trial inmates – all individuals being held overnight in its correctional facilities while awaiting trial.</p>
                    <p>We do not know everything about these inmates that their risk assessment algorithm did. But we do know the amount of their bond, the numbers of days they were detained awaiting trial, and the offense for which they were arrested.</p>

                    <p>What explains these clear racial disparities? <b>Connecticut’s PRAI explicitly ignores the defendant’s race when making its risk assessments</b>. It does, however, consider other data about them.</p>
                    <p>According to the state’s latest report, its PRAI makes its assessments based on the defendant’s current charge, criminal history, marital status, employment, education, substance abuse, mental health, and prior failure to appear in court.<a href='https://www.ct.gov/ctsc/lib/ctsc/Pretrial_Release_and_Detention_in_CT_2.14.2017.pdf'>[4]</a></p>
                    <p>The question is: <b>Should the terms of a defendant’s pre-trial detention be determined by factors such as their employment, education, health, and living situation</b> – given the association between these factors and systemic social and economic inequities?</p>
